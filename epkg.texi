@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Epkg is a package that provides access to a local copy of the
Emacsmirror package database.  It provides low-level functions for
querying the database and a @code{package.el}-like user interface for
browsing the database.

Epkg itself is not a package manager, but the closely related
Borg @footnote{@uref{https://emacsair.me/2016/05/17/assimilate-emacs-packages-as-git-submodules}} package manager makes use of it.

The Emacsmirror is a growing collection of Emacs Lisp packages.  All
mirrored packages are available as Git repositories.  In most cases
this is done by mirroring the upstream Git repository, but if upstream
uses something else, then the mirror nevertheless makes the package
available as a Git repository.

One primary purpose of the Emacsmirror is to provide a comprehensive
list of available Emacs packages, including packages which have gone
out of fashion (but might later prove to be useful still).

Older efforts attempting to provide a comprehensive list of available
packages, such as the Emacs Lisp List, over time collected an
impressive list of dead links to packages which were no longer
available anywhere.

With the Emacsmirror this won't happen.  If a package's upstream
disappears, then a copy remains available on the mirror.  Once its
upstream has disappeared a package is usually moved from the
Emacsmirror to the Emacsattic, where it is no longer updated. (The
Emacsattic is a Github "organization" separate from the Emacsmirror
organization, but it is considered part of the Emacsmirror project.)

For more information about the Emacsmirror visit its homepage @footnote{@uref{https://emacsmirror.net}}
and the blog post in which the current incarnation was
announced @footnote{@uref{https://emacsair.me/2016/04/16/re-introducing-the-emacsmirror}}.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Epkg is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  To install it and its
dependencies run @code{M-x install-package RET epkg RET}.

The Epkg database is stored in an SQLite database, which it accesses
using the EmacSQL package.

Because the command line tool that comes with SQLite is unreliable,
EmacSQL uses its own binary.  By default that binary is compiled every
time EmacSQL is updated, and if that fails, then EmacSQL asks whether
you want to download a pre-build binary.

The SQLite database file is stored in a Git repository.  If Epkg
cannot find your local clone of that repository, then it offers to
clone it to the location specified by the option @code{epkg-repository}.  It
isn't necessary but preferable to clone the repository manually before
loading @code{epkg}.

@example
git clone https://github.com/emacsmirror/epkgs.git ~/.emacs.d/epkgs
@end example

If you cloned the repository to a different location, then you have to
set the value of @code{epkg-repository} accordingly.  Add the following to
your init file and don't forget to evaluate that form so that it also
takes effect in the current session.  To do so place the cursor after
the closing parentheses and type @code{C-M-x}.

@example
(setq epkg-repository "/path/to/epkgs/")
@end example

@defopt epkg-repository

This option specifies the location of the local Emacsmirror
repository.

This repository contains the Epkg SQLite database and, if they have
been initialized, all package repositories from the Emacsmirror and
Emacsattic as submodules.

If you change the value of this option, then you should also
manually move the repository.  Otherwise it would be cloned again.
@end defopt

The local clone of the Epkg repository is not updated automatically,
so you should periodically use @code{M-x epkg-update RET} to update the
database.

@node Listing Packages
@chapter Listing Packages

Epkg provides several commands for listing packages.

In the buffer which lists packages, typing @code{RET} displays information
about the package at point in another buffer.

@defopt epkg-list-packages-omit-shelved

This option controls whether commands that list Epkg packages omit
shelved packages.  By default that is the case.

Shelved packages are those that are no longer updated, and which are
available from the Emacsattic instead of the Emacsmirror.

The command @code{epkg-list-packages-of-type} is not affected by this
option, and neither is @code{epkg-describe-package}.
@end defopt

@defopt epkg-list-columns

This option lists the columns used in buffers that list packages.

Each element has the form @code{(HEADER WIDTH SORTP PROPS SLOT FORMAT)}.
HEADER is the string displayed in the header.  WIDTH is the width
of the column.  If SORTP is @code{t}, then the column can be sorted, if
it is @code{nil} then it can not.  PROPS is an alist, supported keys are
@code{:right-align} and @code{:pad-right}.  SLOT is an Epkg object slot or @code{type}.
FORMAT is a function, which is called with one argument, the slot
value, and has to return a representation of that.  If FORMAT is
@code{nil}, then the value is inserted as-is.
@end defopt

@defopt epkg-list-mode-hook

This hook is run after entering Epkg-List mode, the mode used in
buffers that list packages.
@end defopt

@cindex epkg-list-packages
@deffn Command epkg-list-packages

This command displays a list of all mirrored (and possibly also
shelved) packages.
@end deffn

@cindex epkg-list-matching-packages
@deffn Command epkg-list-matching-packages

This command displays a list of packages whose summaries match a
regular expression, which is read in the minibuffer.
@end deffn

@cindex epkg-list-keyworded-packages
@deffn Command epkg-list-keyworded-packages

This command displays a list of packages that have a keyword set,
which is read in the minibuffer.

Only keywords that are members of @code{finder-known-keywords} are offered
as completion candidates, but you can also enter other keywords.
@end deffn

@cindex epkg-list-packages-by-author
@deffn Command epkg-list-packages-by-author

This command displays a list of packages which are authored or
maintained by a person.  The person, a name or email address, is
read in the minibuffer.
@end deffn

By default all of the above commands omit shelved
packages from their output.  With a prefix argument or when
@code{epkg-list-packages-omit-shelved} is @code{nil}, then they don't omit any
packages.  However the following command ignores this option and
always lists shelved packages when appropriate.

@cindex epkg-list-packages-of-type
@deffn Command epkg-list-packages-of-type

This command displays a list of packages of a certain type.  The
type is read in the minibuffer.  To list all packages of a certain
type and its subtypes use @code{TYPE*} instead of just @code{TYPE}.
@end deffn

@node Describing a Package
@chapter Describing a Package

To display details about a single package in a buffer use the command
@code{epkg-describe-package}.  In buffers which list packages @code{RET} is bound
to @code{epkg-list-describe-package}, which displays the package at point in
another buffer.

By default the description buffer shows a tree of the packages the
described package depends on.  Click on the symbol before the package
name to expand the node to show the dependencies of that dependency.

The first column lists the names of package that provide the
feature(s) in the third column.  The second column shows the type of
the package in the first column.

The features in the third column are displayed in bold or using the
regular font weight to indicate whether it is a hard (mandatory) or
soft (optional) dependency.

Note that dependencies are determined automatically and even when a
feature is shown using a bold face it might actually be optional.
This could for example be the case when a feature is only required by
one library that isn't required by any of the other libraries of the
package it belongs to.  Or a feature might even only be required by a
single command, and the respective @code{require} form is only evaluated when
that command is called.

Reverse dependencies are also displayed in a second tree.  Here the
first column lists the names of packages which depend on features from
the described package and the third column shows which of these
libraries are required.

@cindex epkg-describe-package
@deffn Command epkg-describe-package

This command displays information about a package in a separate
buffer.  The name of the package to be displayed is read in the
minibuffer.
@end deffn

@cindex epkg-list-describe-package
@deffn Command epkg-list-describe-package

This command displays information about the package at point in
a separate buffer.

It is only intended to be used in buffers which list packages.
In other buffers, or in a list buffer when you want to display a
package other than the one at point use @code{epkg-describe-package}.
@end deffn

@defopt epkg-describe-package-slots

The value of this option is a list of slots to be displayed when
displaying information about an Epkg package in a help buffer.

Each element of the list can be a function, a slot symbol, or @code{nil}.
Functions are called with one argument, the Epkg object, and should
insert a representation of the value at point.  Raw slot symbols
cause its non-nil value to be inserted as-is.  If a slot's value is
@code{nil}, then nothing is inserted.  Elements that are @code{nil} stand for
empty lines.
@end defopt

@defopt epkg-describe-package-slots-width

The value of this option specifies the width used to display slot
names in buffers displaying information about an Epkg package.
@end defopt

@node Package Types
@chapter Package Types

Each package has a @strong{type}, which specifies how the package is
distributed and mirrored.

Packages are implemented using the Eieio object system (more or less
in implementation of CLOS).  A TYPE corresponds to the class
@code{epkg-TYPE-package}.  The @code{epkg} package makes little use of methods, but
@code{emir}, the package used to maintain the Emacsmirror, makes extensive
use of them.  There exist five abstract classes (there are no
instances of abstract classes, only of its subclasses): @code{epkg-package},
@code{epkg-mirrored-package}, @code{epkg-gitish-package}, @code{epkg-subset-package}, and
@code{epkg-mocking-package}.  Except for the second these classes are mostly
an implementation detail and not relevant when merely using Epkg to
browse the packages.

@itemize
@item
@code{mirrored}

This is an abstract type.  Unlike other abstract types it is also
useful on the client side, e.g. when you want to list mirrored
packages, but not built-in and shelved packages.

Packages that are available as a repository on the Emacsmirror
(@uref{https://github.com/emacsmirror}).

@itemize
@item
@code{file}

Packages that are distributed as plain files.


@item
@code{gitish}

This is an abstract type, useful when maintaining the mirror.

Git and Mercurial packages.  The name is due to an implementation
detail: @code{hg} is never run directly, instead @code{git-remote-hg} is used.

@itemize
@item
@code{git}

Git packages.

@itemize
@item
@code{github}

Packages hosted on @uref{https://github.com}.

@itemize
@item
@code{orphaned}

Packages that are no longer maintained, but which still have
to be mirrored because other packages depend on them.
Please consider adopting an orphaned package.
@end itemize


@item
@code{gitlab}

Packages hosted on @uref{https://gitlab.com}.


@item
@code{subtree}

Packages that are located in a subtree of a Git repository.
The repository on the Emacsmirror limits the history to just
that directory using @code{git subtree}.


@item
@code{subset}

This is an abstract type, useful when maintaining the mirror.

@itemize
@item
@code{wiki}

Packages hosted as plain files on @uref{https://emacswiki.org}.


@item
@code{elpa}

Packages hosted in a directory inside the @code{master} branch of
the GNU Elpa repository.  These package are available from
@uref{https://elpa.gnu.org}.


@item
@code{elpa-branch}

Packages hosted in the GNU Elpa repository, using a
dedicated branch.  These package are available from
@uref{https://elpa.gnu.org}.
@end itemize
@end itemize


@item
@code{hg}

Mercurial packages.

@itemize
@item
@code{bitbucket}

Packages hosted on @uref{https://bitbucket.org} in a Mercurial
repository.  Packages hosted in a Git repository on Bitbucket
have the type @code{git}.
@end itemize
@end itemize
@end itemize


@item
@code{mocking}

This is an abstract type, useful when maintaining the mirror.

Packages that are @emph{not} available as a repository on the Emacsmirror
(@uref{https://github.com/emacsmirror}).

@itemize
@item
@code{builtin}

Packages that are part of the latest stable GNU Emacs releases.
@code{emacs} is one of the packages that are "part of Emacs"; it contains
all libraries that are not explicitly declared to be part of some
other built-in package.


@item
@code{shelved}

Packages that are available as a repository on the Emacsattic
(@uref{https://github.com/emacsattic}).

These repository are not being updated anymore, because upstream
has disappeared or because the package has issues which have to be
resolved before it can be moved back to the Emacsmirror.
@end itemize
@end itemize

@node Updating the Database
@chapter Updating the Database

@cindex epkg-update
@deffn Command epkg-update

This command updates the Epkg database by pulling the @code{master} branch
in the @code{epkg-repository} and then reloading the Epkg database.  It
returns the database connection.
@end deffn

@node Querying the Database
@chapter Querying the Database

@defun epkg-db

This function returns the connection to the Epkg database.

If the @code{epkg-repository}, which contains the SQLite database file,
does not exist yet, then this function first asks the user whether
they want to clone the repository.
@end defun

@defun epkg-sql sql &rest args

This function sends the SQL S-expression to the Epkg database and
returns the result.  This is a wrapper around @code{emacsql} that lacks the
CONNECTION argument.  Instead it uses the connection returned by
@code{epkg-db}.
@end defun

@defun epkg name

This function returns an @code{epkg-package} object for the package named
NAME.  NAME is the name of a package, a string.
@end defun

@defun epkgs &optional select predicates

This function returns a list of @code{epkg-package} objects or a list of
database rows.  The list is ordered by the package names in
ascending order.

If optional SELECT is non-nil, then it has to be a list of columns
of the @code{packages} table.  In that case the returned value is a list of
database rows.

If optional PREDICATES is non-nil, then it has to be a list of
package class predicate functions, or a single such function.
Valid functions are named either @code{epkg-TYPE-package-p} or
@code{epkg-TYPE-package--eieio-childp}.  Only packages are returned
for which one of these predicates returns non-nil.

This function is more limited than @code{epkg-sql} but it's often much less
verbose.  For example @code{(epkgs nil 'epkg-gitlab-package-p)} returns the
same value as:

@lisp
(mapcar (apply-partially #'closql--remake-instance (epkg-db))
	  (epkg-sql [:select * :from packages
		     :where class :in $v1
		     :order-by [(asc name)]]
		    (closql--where-class-in (epkg-db)
					    'epkg-gitlab-package-p)))
@end lisp
@end defun

While it is possible to get a list of provided or required features,
or a package's type using @code{oref}, the values of these slots contains
additional information, which is mostly useful when maintaining the
Emacsmirror, but not in a client.  And the @code{required} slot only lists
features but not the packages that provide them.  The following
functions return these values in a form that is generally more useful.

@defun epkg-provided package

This function returns a list of features provided by the package
PACKAGE.  PACKAGE is an @code{epkg-package} object or a package name, a
string.
@end defun

@defun epkg-required package

This function returns a list of packages and features required by
the package PACKAGE.  PACKAGE is an @code{epkg-package} object or a package
name, a string.

Each element has the form @code{(PACKAGE FEATURE...)}, where PACKAGE is the
name of a package, a string, and FEATURE is a feature provided by
that package.  If FEATURE is a symbol, then it is a hard (mandatory)
dependency; if it is a string, then it is a soft (optional)
dependency.

PACKAGE is @code{nil} if it is unknown which package provides the FEATURE.
When a dependency cannot be resolved then this function in some
cases uses a heuristic to guess the correct package or to ignore a
self-referential dependency.  This is the case when the FEATURE is
one of @code{NAME-autoloads}, @code{NAME-loaddefs}, @code{NAME-version}, @code{NAME-test}, and
@code{NAME-tests}.
@end defun

@defun epkg-reverse-dependencies package

This function returns a list of packages that depend on PACKAGE.

Each element has the form @code{(PACKAGE FEATURE...)}, where PACKAGE is the
name of a package, a string, and FEATURE is a feature required by
that package.  If FEATURE is a symbol, then it is a hard (mandatory)
dependency; if it is a string, then it is a soft (optional)
dependency.
@end defun

@defun epkg-type pkg

This function returns the type of the @code{epkg-package} object PKG.

A package's type is a short representation of its class, as in
@code{epkg-TYPE-package}.  The argument may also be a class symbol, in
which case the respective type is returned. The type of @code{epkg-package}
itself is @code{all}.
@end defun

@defun epkg-package-types subtypes

This function returns a list of all package types.

If optional SUBTYPES is non-nil, then it also returns symbols of the
form @code{TYPE*}, which stands for "@code{TYPE} and its subtypes".
@end defun

@defun epkg-read-type prompt &optional default subtypes

This function reads an Epkg type in the minibuffer and returns it as
a symbol.

If optional DEFAULT is non-nil, then that is offered as default
choice.  If optional CHILDP is non-nil, then entries of the form
@code{TYPE*}, which stands for "@code{TYPE} and its subtypes", are also offered
as completion candidates.
@end defun

@defun epkg-read-package prompt &optional default

This function reads the name of an Epkg package in the minibuffer
and returns it as a string.

Optional DEFAULT, if non-nil, is offered as default choice.
@end defun

@bye
